Optimizer
==============

TSASE hold the following optimization routines:


Limited memory BFGS
-------------------

    A limited memory version of the bfgs algorithm. Unlike the bfgs algorithm
    used in bfgs.py, the inverse of Hessian matrix is updated.  The inverse
    Hessian is represented only as a diagonal matrix to save memory

    This version of LBFGS is based off of ASE implementation with a few improvements



MDMin:
------
    
    MDmin class from ASE which takes an atoms object and locally minimizes for a given maximum step


Optimize:
---------

   A module that needs a description.  Utilizes MD for local optimization

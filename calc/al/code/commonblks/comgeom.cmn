c             ax, ay and az are the lengths of the simulation cell sides.                 
c             alpha is the angle between the ax and ay vectors, beta the                  
c             angle between the ay and az and gamma betwee ax and az.                     
c             zsurf,zbott,indzbott,indzsurf are used to keep track of top
c                   and bottom layer in z direction.
